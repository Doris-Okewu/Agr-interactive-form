# Agri-Interactive Form: A Modern Registration Tool with Agricultural Flair

## Overview
This is a responsive, interactive registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed for an agricultural community signup, featuring real-time validation for name, email, phone, and password fields. Errors appear dynamically, and valid submissions trigger a success message—all without page reloads. The earthy green theme and smooth animations make it user-friendly and visually appealing.

*Key Features:*
- Real-time input validation (e.g., email regex, strong password rules).
- Focus/blur events for intuitive UX.
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop.
- Agricultural theme inspired by my farming background—perfect for farm co-ops or ag-tech platforms.
